                <h2>Welcome to The Final Frontier!</h2>
            <p>Ever since man was created, we have looked up into the heavens and yearned to know more of our God's creations. Many fantasize about what could be out there in the vast universe. Are there more beings like us? Are they made in our Father's image or do they resemble something else entirely? Given it's connection with science, many seem to disconnect space and what is within it to the divine.</p>
            <p>Space is, whether you have a belief in God or not, a reality. Why not attempt to understand it and learn more about the nature of our Father, eternity and even the nature of creation itself? The Final Frontier, the world's leading (fictional) observatory in interstellar study aims to do just this.</p>

                <h2>Our Goal</h2>
            <p>Through proper study with the concepts of God in mind, we explore the stars, planets and all celestial bodies; seeking understanding of their positions, compositions, patterns and behaviors to understand why an all-knowing creator would place them where they are and have them do what they are doing.</p>
            <p>We do this to prove beyond emotion, beyond individual witnesses, of the divinity of God. To show that science is not at odds with religion, but to learn of how God's universe works.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section2">
                <h2>Why?</h2>
            <p>All too often, we tend to separate the exploration, experimentation and examination of our skies from the divine. As if looking beyond the atmosphere is proof that there is no heaven above us. However, there is no where in scripture that states that heaven is literally sitting in the clouds. It is often used to portray God's command of the land, seas and skies.</p>
            <p>The desire to bridge the gap between science and religion is the reason for this website's conception. For one can be used to better understand the other, and that neither are truely opposites.</p>
