Site Name: The Final Frontier. 
 - I chose this name because it's a popular phrase associated with space exploration. And implying the connection to the Mormon Pioneers and their travels into the western Frontier.

Site Purpose: The purpose of this site is to explore the intersection of space exploration and spirituality. It aims to provide insights, articles, and discussions on how venturing into space can align with gospel teachings and what it means for our understanding of creation and our place in the universe.

Scenarios:
 - What could expanding the human preasence into space teach us about God's creation?
 - Would it be something God condones or something He opposes?
